# Web Developer and Designer

## RATE

$65 p/r

Hi I'm Mitch! I'm a front-end web developer from Sydney Australia. My early career started with Flash (those were the days!) and then I moved into front-end web development. I've spent over ten years designing, coding and freelancing with a keen enthusiasm for the web and a focus for top-notch communication.

To go a bit deeper, my freelancing business up to now has been specialising in custom website builds for digital agencies. Leveraging static site generators (Jekyll) to scaffold websites quickly for client previews. Developing Vue.js apps and widgets. Expertise in advanced responsive web design and mobile strategy. And providing cost effective solutions for agencies seeking scalable, high quality front-end site builds.

## STRENGTHS

- Cross Compatibility Getting sites to run well on all modern browsers (incl. IE11+).
- Designing in the browser Saving time by moving to dev quickly and working iteratively within the web's constraints.
- Optimisation Getting sites to run fast and perform well.
- Rapid Prototyping Solving problems quickly in-browser with interaction and UX.
- Responsive Web Design Ability to translate designs into mobile-ready concepts.  Advanced skills in building complex responsive websites.
